and without the need of having deep knowledge on how cryptography works.

- High-security, standards-based encryption techniques, both for unidirectional and bidirectional encryption. Encrypt passwords, texts, numbers, binaries...

- Transparent integration with Hibernate.

- Suitable for integration into Spring-based applications and also transparently integrable with Spring Security.

- Integrated capabilities for encrypting the configuration of applications (i.e. datasources).

- Specific features for high-performance encryption in multi-processor/multi-core systems.

- Open API for use with any JCE provider.
