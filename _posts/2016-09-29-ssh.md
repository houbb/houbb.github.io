# DESCRIPTION

ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. 
It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. 
X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

- The simple demo

```
$   ssh root@139.196.28.128
```

ssh connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name). 
The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).
If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.

If command is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.
The options are as follows:


| opt           |   description |
| :------------ |:----------    |
| -1    | Forces ssh to try protocol version 1 only.|
| -2    | Forces ssh to try protocol version 2 only.|
| -4    | Forces ssh to use IPv4 addresses only.|
| -5    | Forces ssh to use IPv6 addresses only.|
