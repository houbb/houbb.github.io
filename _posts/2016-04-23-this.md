* any list
{:toc}

We use keyword **this**  every where, and even not konw about it

## Setter ##
code like this.

{% highlight java %}

public class Counter {
    private int i;

    public int getI() {
        return i;
    }

    public void setI(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }
}

{% endhighlight%}


- If you not use **this** int setI(), what will happend?

```java
public void setI(int i) {
    i = i;
}
```

i is just assign to itself, not Counter.i;

- Why we use **this** ? You may say I can do it like this

```java
public void setI(int j) {
    i = j;
}
```

That's also work, but you need always think other name for the varaible, it cost
time and not awesome.

> **this** is the reference of current object; Use **this.member** will solve the problem above.


## Constructor
code

```java

public class Counter {
    private int i;
    private String name;

    public Counter(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

    public Counter(int i, String name) {
        this(i);
        this.name = name;
    }
}

```
> Note

- this() must at the first line in the constructor;

- Not allowed to use two or more this() in the constructor;

```java
public class Counter {
    private int i;
    private String name;

    public Counter(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

    public Counter(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Counter(int i, String name) {
        this(i);
        this(name);	//error
    }

}
```

## return the reference of Object
code

```java
public class Counter {
    private int i;

    public Counter(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

    public int getI() {
        return i;
    }

    public void setI(int i) {
        this.i = i;
    }

    Counter increase() {
        i++;
        return this;
    }
}
```

test

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Counter counter = new Counter(100);

    System.out.println(counter.increase().increase().getI());
}
```

result

```java
102
```

> Note

- It's very cool when object can use like this. **Chain calls** is common in jQuery, and I enjoy it.

- If your method not need a return value, you may think return the refernce of the Object;
