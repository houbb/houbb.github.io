# Mono

Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications part of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/).


一、 Install Mono on Mac OS X


1. [Download](http://www.mono-project.com/download/) the latest Mono release for Mac
 
2. Run the ```*.pkg``` file and accept the terms of the license

3. After the installation completed successfully, it’s a good idea to run through the basic [hello world](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/) example.
