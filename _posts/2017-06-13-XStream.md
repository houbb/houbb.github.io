# XStream

[XStream](http://x-stream.github.io/) is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.


> Features

- Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common use cases.

- No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need for specifying mappings.

- Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.

- Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans and more compact than native Java serialization.

- Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields, including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.

- Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.

- Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface, XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just XML).

- Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered allowing customization of how particular types are represented as XML.

- Security framework. Fine-control about the unmarshalled types to prevent security issues with manipulated input.

- Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the problem.

- Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

- Typical Uses
