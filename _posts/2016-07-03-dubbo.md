# Dobbo

Dubbo is a distributed, high performance RPC framework which empowers applications with service import/export capabilities.

It contains three key parts, which include:

- Remoting: a network communication framework providing sync-over-async and request-response messaging.
- Clustering: a remote procedure call abstraction with load-balancing/failover/clustering capabilities.
- Registration: a service directory framework for service registration and service event publish/subscription
