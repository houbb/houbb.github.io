# QLNet

[QLNet](https://github.com/amaggiulli/qlnet) C# library official repository. 

QLNet is a financial library written in C# for the Windows enviroment derived primarily from its C++ counterpart, Quantlib, 
which has been used as a base reference for modelling various financial instruments. QLNet also contains new developments on the bond market like MBS,
Amortized Cost, PSA Curve and others.


# JQuantLib

[JQuantLib](http://www.jquantlib.org/en/latest/) is a free, open-source, comprehensive framework for quantitative finance, written in 100% Java. 

It provides “quants” and Java application developers several mathematical and statistical tools needed for the valuation of shares, options, futures, swaps, and other financial instruments.

- JQuantLib is based on QuantLib, a well known open-source library for quantitative finance, written in C++. 
JQuantLib aims to be a complete rewrite of QuantLib, offering features Java developers expect to find. 
It aims to be fast, correct, strongly typed, well-documented, and user-friendly.

- JQuantLib does its best to mimic QuantLib/C++ API as close as possible. 
This way, JQuantLib offers a smooth transition path for developers and organizations willing to write financial applications in Java, 
but keeping previous knowledge and investments done on QuantLib.


# QuanltLib4j

为了学习QuantLib，决定自己抽时间将QuantLib转为Java版本。可参考JQuantLib，主要目的是学习。再者现在的JQuantLib一直不全面。
