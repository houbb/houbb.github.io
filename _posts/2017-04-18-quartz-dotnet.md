# Quartz.NET

[Quartz.NET](https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/) is a pure .NET library written in C# and is a port of very popular open source Java job scheduling framework, [Quartz](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/). 

This project owes very much to original Java project, it’s father James House and the project contributors.
