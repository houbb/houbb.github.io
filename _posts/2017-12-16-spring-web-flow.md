# Spring Web Flow
 
[Spring Web Flow](https://projects.spring.io/spring-webflow/) builds on Spring MVC and allows implementing the "flows" of a web application. 

A flow encapsulates a sequence of steps that guide a user through the execution of some business task. 

It spans multiple HTTP requests, has state, deals with transactional data, is reusable, and may be dynamic and long-running in nature..


这个是通过配置，设置页面的跳转流程。个人不是很喜欢，简单的看了些。
