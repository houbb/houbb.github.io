## Google Guava

The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, 
concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth. Each of these tools really do get used every day by Googlers, in production services.
