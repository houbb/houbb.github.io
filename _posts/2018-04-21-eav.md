# EAV
 
[Entity–attribute–value model (EAV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model) is a data model to encode, 
in a space-efficient manner, entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, 
but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. 
Such entities correspond to the mathematical notion of a sparse matrix. 
EAV is also known as object–attribute–value model, vertical database model and open schema.
