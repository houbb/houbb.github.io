# JWT

JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method 
for representing claims securely between two parties.


Let's explain some concepts further.

- Compact 

Because of their smaller size, JWTs can be sent through a URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. 
Additionally, the smaller size means transmission is fast.

- Self-contained

The payload contains all the required information about the user, avoiding the need to query the database more than once.

# 使用场景

## Authentication

This is the most common scenario for using JWT. 
Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, 
allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. 

Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, 
because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

## Information Exchange

JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. 
Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using **public/private** key pairs—you 
can be sure the senders are who they say they are.

Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, 
you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.


# JWT 结构

各个部分之间以 `.` 分割。内容如下：

- Header

- Payload

- Signature

常见的内容如下：

```
XXXXXX.YYYYYYYY.ZZZZZZZ
```

## Header

The header typically consists of two parts: 

the type of the token, which is JWT, 

and the hashing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

eg：

```
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

```

## Payload

Payload, which contains the claims. 

Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. 

There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

### registered claims

These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, 
to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims.

[Registered Claim Names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1)

### public claims

These can be defined at will by those using JWTs.

But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the [IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml) 
or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.

### private claims

These are the custom claims created to share information 
between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.


eg:

```
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
}
```

## Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, 
the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the **HMAC SHA256** algorithm, 
the signature will be created in the following way:

```java
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the way, 
and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, 
it can also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.

## Putting all together

The output is three Base64-URL strings separated by dots that can be easily 
passed in HTML and HTTP environments, 
while being more compact when compared to XML-based standards such as [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

# 工作机制

![2018-03-35-jwt-workflow.png]({{ site.url }}/static/app/img/web/jwt/2018-03-35-jwt-workflow.png)


- 无状态

This is a stateless authentication mechanism as the user state is never saved in server memory. 

The server's protected routes will check for a valid JWT in the Authorization header, 
and if it's present, the user will be allowed to access protected resources. 

As JWTs are self-contained, all the necessary information is there, 
reducing the need to query the database multiple times.

- 私有信息

Do note that with signed tokens, all the information contained within the token is exposed to users or other parties, 
even though they are unable to change it. 

This means you should **not put secret** information within the token.

# 优势何在

- Smaller (means faster)

- Security-wise
