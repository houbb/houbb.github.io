# Lucene

The Apache LuceneTM project develops open-source search software, including:

- **Lucene Core**, our flagship sub-project, provides Java-based indexing and search technology, as well as spellchecking,
hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.

- **Solr** is a high performance search server built using Lucene Core, with XML/HTTP and JSON/Python/Ruby APIs, hit highlighting,
faceted search, caching, replication, and a web admin interface.

- **PyLucene** is a Python port of the Core project.
