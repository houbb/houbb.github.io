# Proxy

> Intent

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

> Applicability

- A **remote proxy** provides a local representative for an object in a different address space.

- A **virtual proxy** creates expensive objects on demand.

- A **protection proxy** controls access to the original object.

- A **smart reference** is a replacement for a bare pointer that performs additional actions when an object is accessed.

> Consequences

- A remote proxy can hide the fact that an object resides in a different address space.

- A virtual proxy can perform optimizations such as creating an object on demand.

- Both protection proxies and smart references allow additional housekeeping tasks when an object is accessed.

## static proxy

> struct

> demo

Suppose we want to add some methods before || after the RealSubject.operation(), how to do ?

- Subject.java

```java
public interface Subject {
    void operation();
}
```

- RealSubject.java

```java
public class RealSubject implements Subject {
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("Real do sth.");
    }
}
```

- ProxySubject.java

```java
public class ProxySubject implements Subject {
    private Subject subject;

    public ProxySubject(Subject subject) {
        this.subject = subject;
    }

    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("before...");
        subject.operation();
        System.out.println("after...");
    }
}
```

- test

```java
public class ProxySubjectTest extends TestCase {
    @Test
    public void testProxy() {
        Subject subject = new ProxySubject(new RealSubject());
        subject.operation();
    }
}
```

- result

```
before...
Real do sth.
after...

Process finished with exit code 0
```

## dynamic proxy

Why we use dynamic proxy ? If there are many methods, it's hard to use static proxy to solve it.

> struct

- Request.java

```java
public interface Request {
    void request();

    void response();
}
```

- RealRequest.java

```java
public class RealRequest implements Request {
    @Override
    public void request() {
        System.out.println("Real request");
    }

    @Override
    public void response() {
        System.out.println("Real response");
    }
}
```

- ProxyHandler.java

We use reflect to dynamic create class file, then the target object is flexible.

```java
package com.ryo.dynamicProxy;

import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;

/**
 * Created by 侯彬彬 on 2016/7/18.
 */
public class ProxyHandler implements InvocationHandler {
    private Object target;

    public Object bind(Object target) {
        this.target = target;

        return Proxy.newProxyInstance(target.getClass().getClassLoader(),
                target.getClass().getInterfaces(),
                this);
    }

    @Override
    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("dynamic before...");
        Object result = method.invoke(target, args);
        System.out.println("dynamic after...\n");

        return result;
    }
}
```

- test

```java
public class DynamicProxyTest extends TestCase {
    @Test
    public void testProxy() {
        ProxyHandler proxyHandler = new ProxyHandler();
        Request request = (Request) proxyHandler.bind(new RealRequest());
        request.request();

        request.response();
    }
}
```

- result

```
dynamic before...
Real request
dynamic after...

dynamic before...
Real response
dynamic after...


Process finished with exit code 0
```

Tips: As you can see, the dynamic proxy of java is depends on ```interface```, if there is no interface, we can use [aspectj](http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/) to solve it.


# Strategy

> Intent

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

> Applicability

- many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategy is provide a way to configure a class with one of many behaviors.

- you need different variants of an algorithm. For example, you might define algorithms reflecting different space/time trade-offs.

Strategies can be used when these variants are implemented as a classhierarchy of algorithms [HO87].

- an algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about. Use the Strategy pattern to avoid exposing complex, algorithm-specific data structures.

- a class defines many behaviors, and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations.
Instead of many conditionals, move related conditional branches into their own Strategy class.

> Struct

![Strategy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/houbb/resource/master/img/2016-07-19-strategy.png)


> Consequences

- Inheritance can help **factor out common functionality** of the algorithms.

- Encapsulating the algorithm in separate Strategy classes lets you vary the algorithm independently of its context, making it easier to switch, understand, and extend.

- Strategies eliminate conditional statements.

- Strategies can provide different implementations of the same behavior. The client can choose among strategies with different time and space trade-offs.

*shortcoming*

- Clients must be aware of different Strategies.

- Communication overhead between Strategy and Context.

- Increased number of objects.


> Implementation

Suppose we has different count for different level customers.

- common member: no count

- advanced member: 0.9

- VIP: 0.7


Here is the code:

- PriceStrategy.java

```java
public interface PriceStrategy {
    double calcPrice(double price);
}
```

- CommonMemberStrategy.java

```java
public class CommonMemberStrategy implements PriceStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calcPrice(double price) {
        System.out.println("Common member has no count...");

        return price;
    }
}
```

- AdvancedMemberStrategy.java

```java
public class AdvancedMemberStrategy implements PriceStrategy {
    private static final double COUNT = 0.9;

    @Override
    public double calcPrice(double price) {
        System.out.println("Advanced member has the count of " + COUNT);

        return price * COUNT;
    }
}
```

- VIPStrategy.java

```java
public class VIPStrategy implements PriceStrategy {
    private static final double COUNT = 0.7;

    @Override
    public double calcPrice(double price) {
        System.out.println("VIP has the count of " + COUNT);

        return price * COUNT;
    }
}
```

- Price.java

```java
public class Price {
    private PriceStrategy priceStrategy;

    public Price(PriceStrategy priceStrategy) {
        this.priceStrategy = priceStrategy;
    }

    public double getPrice(double price) {
        return priceStrategy.calcPrice(price);
    }
}
```

- test

```java
public class PriceTest extends TestCase {
    public void testGetPrice() {
        final double PRICE  = 10.0;

        Price price = new Price(new CommonMemberStrategy());
        price.getPrice(PRICE);

        Price price1 = new Price(new AdvancedMemberStrategy());
        price1.getPrice(PRICE);

        Price price2 = new Price(new VIPStrategy());
        price2.getPrice(PRICE);
    }
}
```

- result

```
Common member has no count...
Advanced member has the count of 0.9
VIP has the count of 0.7

Process finished with exit code 0
```
