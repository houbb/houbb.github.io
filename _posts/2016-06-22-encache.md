# Encache

Ehcache is an open source, standards-based cache that boosts performance, offloads your database, and simplifies scalability.
It's the most widely-used Java-based cache because it's robust, proven, full-featured, and integrates with other popular libraries and frameworks.
Ehcache scales from in-process caching, all the way to mixed in-process/out-of-process deployments with terabyte-sized caches.
