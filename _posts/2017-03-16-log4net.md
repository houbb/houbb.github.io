# Log4net

The Apache [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) library is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets.
 
log4net is a port of the excellent Apache log4j™ framework to the Microsoft® .NET runtime. We have kept the framework similar in spirit to the original
 
log4j while taking advantage of new features in the .NET runtime. For more information on log4net see the features document.
